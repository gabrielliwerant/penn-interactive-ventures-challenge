## Chuck Norris Facts

Want to know everything you can about Chuck Norris? I don't blame you.

The app displays a table of Chuck Norris facts, with pagination, and search filter (searches look for all facts that contain the input text and displays only those).

Styling is kept minimal, as is application organization file/folder structure.

Documentation is in the JSDoc style (https://devdocs.io/jsdoc/).

I invented the example "fact" myself!

### Running app

- Load `index.html` in Chrome browser

### Running tests

- Tests run once `index.html` loads (from `tests.js`) and results appear in the console automatically

### Roadmap

- Add search filter selection via dropdown that allows changing search field (e.g. by "Id" instead of by "Fact" text)
- Add a column for the "Category" field
- Allow sorting columns asc/desc alphabetical order or numerical value
